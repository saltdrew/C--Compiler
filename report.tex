\section*{Introduction}

In this report, the implementation of the Compiler for --C will be outlined and explained. The first (only) part of this project to be covered is Interpretation, where an abstract syntax tree (AST) is taken as input, and the answer is given as output. In this project, the answer is considered to be the value returned by the main function. 

\section*{Interpretation}

\subsection{Linear Programs}

In order to interpret linear programs, the AST produced from the lexer is traversed in an order dictated by the value of the node discovered. To do this I wrote a function called wallk which takes a tree (node object) as a parameter and returns an integer.
